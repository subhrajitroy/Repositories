The purpose of this project is to provide a library
that you can just drop in and use as your persistence layer
without having to write the whole boiler plate code again and
again . I hope this will be useful in particular when you
are trying some poc and need a persistence layer but do not want
to spend too much time worrying and coding the repository layer.

I have just started writing and it will take sometime before it is in
some usable state.
